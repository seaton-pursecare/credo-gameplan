## Changes Made

### 1. Main Architecture Diagram Updates

#### **Problem Identified**
- Istio service mesh was positioned incorrectly in the original diagram
- Components were separated into a separate "EKS Cluster Components" section
- Traffic flow was unclear: ALB â†’ EKS â†’ Istio â†’ Applications

#### **Solution Implemented**
- **Moved Istio components into EKS cluster subnets**: Relocated Istio, Applications, and OpenTelemetry components directly into the Dev and Prod private subnets where the EKS clusters reside
- **Updated traffic flow**: Clarified the flow as `ALB â†’ EKS â†’ Istio â†’ Applications`
- **Added distinct styling**: Created a new `istio` class with light blue color (`#e8eaf6`) to distinguish Istio components
- **Removed redundant section**: Eliminated the separate "EKS Cluster Components" subgraph that was duplicating components

#### **Technical Details**
```mermaid
# Before (Incorrect)
DevEKS[EKS Cluster - Dev]
# Separate section with:
DevIstio[Istio Service Mesh]
DevApps[Containerized Applications]

# After (Correct)
subgraph "Dev Private Subnet (10.0.2.0/24)"
    DevEKS[EKS Cluster - Dev]
    DevIstio[Istio Service Mesh]
    DevApps[Containerized Applications]
    DevOTEL[OpenTelemetry Collectors]
    DevSigNoz[SigNoz Monitoring]
    DevVault[Hashicorp Vault - TBT Manager]
end
```

### 2. Security Zones Diagram Updates

#### **Problem Identified**
- Application Zone showed EKS and Applications without Istio in between
- Traffic flow was: `EKS â†’ Apps` (missing Istio layer)

#### **Solution Implemented**
- **Reordered components**: Changed from `EKS â†’ Apps` to `EKS â†’ Istio â†’ Apps`
- **Updated traffic flow**: Added explicit Istio layer in the Application Zone
- **Maintained security boundaries**: Kept Istio within the Application Zone as intended

#### **Technical Details**
```mermaid
# Before
subgraph "Application Zone"
    EKS[EKS Clusters]
    Apps[Applications]
    Istio[Istio Service Mesh]
end

# After
subgraph "Application Zone"
    EKS[EKS Clusters]
    Istio[Istio Service Mesh]
    Apps[Applications]
end

# Traffic flow updated from:
ALB --> EKS
EKS --> Apps

# To:
ALB --> EKS
EKS --> Istio
Istio --> Apps
```

### 3. New Istio Service Mesh Architecture Diagram

#### **Addition Made**
- **Created detailed Istio diagram**: Added comprehensive diagram showing internal Istio components within EKS clusters
- **Component breakdown**: Included Ingress Gateway, Control Plane (Pilot, Citadel, Galley), Data Plane (Envoy Proxies), and Observability tools
- **Traffic flow visualization**: Showed how traffic flows through the service mesh and component interactions
- **Color-coded sections**: Used distinct colors for different layers (ingress, control, data, app, observability)

#### **Technical Details**
```mermaid
subgraph "EKS Cluster"
    subgraph "Ingress Layer"
        ALB[Application Load Balancer]
        IngressGateway[Istio Ingress Gateway]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service Mesh Control Plane"
        Pilot[Pilot - Service Discovery]
        Citadel[Citadel - Certificate Management]
        Galley[Galley - Configuration Validation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Plane"
        Proxy1[Envoy Proxy - Service A]
        Proxy2[Envoy Proxy - Service B]
        Proxy3[Envoy Proxy - Service C]
    end
    
    subgraph "Applications"
        ServiceA[Service A]
        ServiceB[Service B]
        ServiceC[Service C]
    end
    
    subgraph "Observability"
        Jaeger[Jaeger - Distributed Tracing]
        Kiali[Kiali - Service Mesh Visualization]
        Prometheus[Prometheus - Metrics]
    end
end
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Clear Traffic Flow**
- **External Traffic**: `Internet â†’ WAF â†’ ALB â†’ EKS â†’ Istio â†’ Applications`
- **Internal Traffic**: `Applications â†’ Istio â†’ Applications` (service-to-service)
- **Management Traffic**: `Control Plane â†’ Data Plane` (Istio management)

### 2. **Security Improvements**
- **Network Segmentation**: Proper placement of Istio within private subnets
- **Traffic Management**: All traffic flows through Istio for security policies
- **Observability**: Complete visibility into service mesh traffic

### 3. **Operational Benefits**
- **Service Discovery**: Istio handles service discovery and routing
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent load balancing across service instances
- **Circuit Breaking**: Automatic failure handling and retry logic
- **Distributed Tracing**: Complete request tracing across services

## Database Integration (Previously Added)

### Vault Time-Based Token Management
- **Secure Database Access**: Applications use time-based tokens from Vault for RDS access
- **Token Lifecycle**: Automatic token rotation and expiration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of database access patterns

### Database Connections
- **Dev Environment**: `DevApps â†’ DevVault â†’ DevRDS`
- **Prod Environment**: `ProdApps â†’ ProdVault â†’ ProdRDS`
- **Security**: No hardcoded credentials, all managed through Vault

## Validation Checklist

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Istio properly positioned behind ALB in EKS clusters
- [x] Traffic flow clearly shows: ALB â†’ EKS â†’ Istio â†’ Applications
- [x] Security zones properly reflect Istio placement
- [x] New detailed Istio architecture diagram added
- [x] Database integration with Vault TBT management documented
- [x] Color coding and styling updated for clarity

### ðŸ”„ Future Considerations
- [ ] Add Istio configuration examples
- [ ] Document Istio security policies
- [ ] Add service mesh monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Create Istio troubleshooting guides

## Files Modified
