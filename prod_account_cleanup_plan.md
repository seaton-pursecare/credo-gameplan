# Production Account Cleanup Plan

## Overview

This plan focuses on cleaning up the existing AWS account that will become production-only after the Dev account is established. **The cleanup will be based on findings and learnings from the Dev account setup and resource import process.** The goal is to remove unused resources, clean up IAM, and optimize the production environment for security and cost efficiency.

## 🎯 Cleanup Goals

- **Remove Unused Resources**: Clean up unused EC2, RDS, Lambda, and other resources
- **IAM Cleanup**: Remove unused roles, policies, and users
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduce unnecessary costs
- **Security Hardening**: Improve security posture
- **Production Focus**: Optimize for production workloads only

## 📋 Cleanup Scope

**Note: This cleanup will be executed AFTER the Dev account setup and resource import process is complete. The cleanup approach will be based on findings from the Dev account work.**

### Phase 1: Apply Dev Account Learnings (Weeks 1-2)
- Apply IAM cleanup strategies learned from Dev account
- Use resource import findings to identify unused resources
- Apply security best practices from Dev account setup
- Document production-specific requirements

### Phase 2: IAM Cleanup Based on Dev Learnings (Weeks 3-4)
- Apply IAM cleanup patterns from Dev account
- Remove unused and overprivileged access identified in Dev work
- Implement least privilege principles learned from Dev setup
- Clean up inline policies and unused policies

### Phase 3: Resource Cleanup Based on Dev Findings (Weeks 5-6)
- Remove resources identified as unused during Dev import process
- Clean up resources that were successfully migrated to Dev
- Remove development-specific resources that are no longer needed
- Optimize remaining production resources

### Phase 4: Production Security Hardening (Weeks 7-8)
- Implement production-specific security best practices
- Configure monitoring and alerting for production workloads
- Set up compliance monitoring for production environment
- Document production procedures and runbooks
