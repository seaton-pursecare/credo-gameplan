# AWS Cognito Migration Plan - Production to New Account

## Overview

This plan outlines the migration of production Cognito from the current AWS account to a new dedicated production AWS account, while maintaining minimal customer impact and ensuring zero downtime.

## 🎯 Migration Goals

- **Zero Downtime**: Maintain continuous service during migration
- **Minimal Customer Impact**: Seamless transition for end users
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure all user data and configurations are preserved
- **Security**: Maintain or improve security posture
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to quickly revert if issues arise

## 📋 Current State Analysis

### Current Setup
- **Single AWS Account**: Contains both Prod and Dev Cognito instances
- **Prod Cognito**: Active production user pool
- **Dev Cognito**: Development/testing user pool
- **Shared Resources**: Other AWS services in the same account

### Target State
- **New Production Account**: Dedicated account for production Cognito
- **Existing Account**: Retain Dev Cognito and other services
- **Account Separation**: Clear separation of production and development environments
